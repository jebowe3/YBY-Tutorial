ADMIRALTY HOUSE,Whitehall,"The Old Admiralty Offices in Whitehall are mentioned in four Sherlock Holmes adventures. In 1874, this is where it was set down that the convict ship 'The Gloria Scott"" was lost at sea. No word ever leaked out as to her true fate. In 1895, with the death of Arthur Cadogan West, and the missing Bruce-Partington Plans, the Admiralty was buzzing like an overturned beehive. Mycroft said, “He had never seen the Prime Minister so upset”. In the 1903 Adventure of the Priory School, it was mentioned that the Duke of Holdernesse had been First Lord of the Admiralty, with offices at Whitehall. Finally, in 1914, Von Bork complained that The Admiralty had changed every naval code. Nevertheless, thanks to his checkbook, and his agent Altamont, he would soon get the new signals.

People from all over the world wrote Sherlock and the Royal Mail delivered all of the letters to the Abbey House. The company had to hire a full-time, “Secretary to Mr.Holmes”, to handle the correspondence. I think they enjoyed the notoriety, because in the 1951 Festival of Britain, the society hosted the display of Sherlock Holmes material.

Bates said he was leaving Gibson’s employment, but wanted to tell Holmes that Gibson was cunning and should not be trusted. In 1914, after capturing the German agent Von Bork in His Last Bow, Holmes returned to Claridge’s, shaved off his goatee, and reappeared as himself. In 1914, Holmes had given up his Baker Street rooms, and as Altamont, was staying at Claridge’s. Because Watson was helping in the case, I think he also lived at Claridge's on the German government money being paid to Holmes. Based on their comradeship, they probably had adjoining rooms, or perhaps a two bedroom suite. Of all the Central London hotels mentioned in the Sherlock Holmes adventures, Claridge’s is the only one in which Sherlock (and perhaps Watson) were guests.

In 1902, Nathan Garrideb left Euston on the 12.05 train to Aston in hopes of finding the third Garrideb. The late Bernard Davies identified the 12:05 as the only train that allowed a ""halt-on-demand"" stop at Aston. In 1903, because of the press of other cases, Holmes could not accompany Dodd back to Tuxbury Old Place. The following week, when he and Watson did go, Holmes arranged for Sir James Saunders to meet them at Euston Station.

"31 ""221B"" BAKER STREET",,"As chronicled in A Study in Scarlet, Holmes and Watson met in 1881. They wanted to find someone with whom to share cheaper quarters. The going rate at Watson's hotel would have been about six shillings per day. This means that Holmes and Watson needed accommodations that rented for between twelve and fifteen pounds a month. They went to inspect rooms at Mrs. Hudson's 221B Baker Street. Her accommodations included, ""A couple of comfortable bedrooms and a single large airy sitting room, cheerfully furnished, and illuminated by two broad windows.” In later adventures, we learn that Watson’s bedroom was on the floor above, and Sherlock’s bedroom eventually had three doors: one leading to the sitting room, a second exiting into the hallway and later, a third door hidden behind the sitting room curtains. In 1881, the name “Baker Street” applied only that section of the modern street, south of Paddington Street. The portion of the street north of Paddington, to Marylebone was known as York Place. North of York Place, the street was called Upper Baker Street. As an added puzzle to Sherlockians, the highest house number, on nineteenth century Baker Street, was 85. This meant that Conan Doyle hid the true location of 221B, until he revealed it as today’s 31 Baker Street in the 1894 Adventure of the Empty House. During their first week at Baker Street, Watson learned that Holmes had acquaintances from all classes of society. Holmes explained that these were his clients, and that he was the world’s only “consulting detective.” One morning, Holmes received a note from Inspector Tobias Gregson, and showed it to Watson. The note said, “There has been bad business at 3 Lauriston Gardens, off Brixton Road.” Enoch J. Drebber of Cleveland, Ohio had been murdered. Holmes explained that, “Gregson is the smartest of the Scotland Yarders”, and that, “He and Lestrade are the pick of a bad lot.” Holmes asked Watson to get his hat.

Once inside, Watson was surprised to see their old 221B quarters directly across the street.

When Mary went to see her father, he was not there. The hotel said he had gone out the night before and had not returned.

PADDINGTON RAILWAY STATION,,"Paddington Station was mentioned in five Sherlock Holmes adventures. In the summer of 1889, during The Adventure of the Engineer's Thumb, two men came from the Station. One was a station guard, and the other was Victor Hatherley. Hatherley had previously departed from Paddington to meet Colonel Lysander Stark in Eyford, near Reading. When he returned, he had lost his thumb, and needed medical attention. In the 1889 Boscombe Valley Mystery, Watson arrived at Paddington and found, “Sherlock Holmes…pacing up and down the platform, his tall gaunt figure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey traveling-cloak and the close-fitting cloth cap”. This may be the first mention of Sherlock’s, now famous, dear-stalker hat. In the 1889 Hound of the Baskervilles, after Holmes and Watson met Sir Henry and Dr. Mortimer at the Northumberland Hotel, they agreed that Watson would accompany Sir Henry to Baskerville Hall, on Saturday’s ten-thirty train from Paddington. Because of the press of other business, Holmes said he could not go at that time. In the 1890 Adventure of Silver Blaze, Holmes asked Watson to accompany him to the King’s Pyland training stable in Dartmoor. Silver Blaze, the horse favored to win the Wessex Cup, was missing, and his trainer murdered. Holmes and Watson were just in time to catch the Dartmoor train from Paddington. On the trip, Holmes wore his ear-flapped traveling cap, (A reference to his famous deerstalker). As an amusement, he calculated the train’s speed by observing and timing the passing telegraph poles. In the 1901 Adventure of Shoscombe Old Place John Mason said that in addition to the other strange happenings at Shoscombe Old Place, Sir Robert had started going down to the old church crypt at night, and meeting a stranger there. When Holmes asked Mason about the fishing in that part of Berkshire, Mason thought the craziness might be catching. Holmes said that he and Watson would take the train from Paddington Station, and come down posing as a pair of London anglers.

In the 1889 Boscombe Valley Mystery, McCarthy saw Turner on Regent Street and blackmailed him. He threatened to expose his criminal past. The threat resulted in McCarthy acquiring Hatherley Farm, rent-free. In the 1889 Hound of the Baskervilles mystery, Holmes and Watson noticed a hansom cab following Sir Henry as he walked along Regent Street. Holmes tried to get a good look at the passenger, but the cab sped away, Holmes now knew that Baskerville had been closely shadowed since he arrived in London.

YOUNG SHERLOCK'S,,"In the 1874 Adventure of the ""Gloria Scott"", Holmes was invited to visit Donnithorpe, the country estate of Victor Trevor's father. After Holmes’s observations, the old man felt uneasy around Holmes. To keep from embarrassing Victor, Holmes returned to his Montague Street rooms in London. There, Holmes received a telegram from Trevor, imploring him to return. In his early days in London, Holmes had rooms in Montague Street. He was just out of college, and wanted quarters near the British Museum’s Reading Room. In the 1879 Adventure of the Musgrave Ritual, Holmes received a visit from Reginald Musgrave. Musgrave had been at Sherlock’s college, and after his father’s death, had taken over the family estate. Musgrave said he needed Holmes’s help. There is no indication that Holmes’s Montague Street rooms were at the same location in 1879, as they were in 1874. In fact, since it is likely that he finished college between these dates, and given the state of his finances, it does not seem logical that he would have retained London quarters. Author’s note: On one of my trips to London, I talked to the owner of the private Ruskin Hotel. He claimed his modest Bed & Breakfast was the location of Sherlock’s Montague Street lodging, a claim that is undoable good for business.

WATERLOO RR STATION,,"Waterloo Station is mentioned in eight Sherlock Holmes adventures. In the 1883 Adventure of the Speckled Band, Helen Stoner left Leatherhead on the first train to Waterloo Station. She wanted to consult Holmes on the strange events at Stoke Moran. Later in the day, Holmes and Watson left London for Leatherhead from Waterloo Station. In the 1885, Adventure of The Five Orange Pips, John Openshaw arrived in London at Waterloo Station. After Openshaw visited Holmes, he tried to catch the late train back to Horsham, but on the way to the station, he was attacked and killed. One summer night in 1888, at the beginning of The Adventure of the Crooked Man, Watson was staying up late. His wife and the rest of the household had gone to bed, when there was a knock at the door. It was Holmes, who had just come from Waterloo Station. He had arrived from Aldershot, and asked Watson to accompany him when he returned the next day. In 1889, during The Adventure of The Naval Treaty, Holmes and Watson caught an early train from Waterloo Station. to Briarbrae, Percy Phelp’s home. It was a large detached house; just a few minutes walk from Woking Station. Later that day, when Holmes and Watson returned to London, they ate at the Waterloo Station’s buffet. Later in 1889, Scotland Yard assigned Inspector Lestrade to the case Watson called The Adventure of the Cardboard Box. Lestrade sent a note from Croydon, asking for Holmes help. Holmes and Watson left for Croydon from Waterloo Station. Also in 1889, Dr. Mortimer did not know what to tell Sir Henry when he arrived at Waterloo Station. Sir Henry was the last of the Baskervilles, and Dr. Mortimer felt hesitant about telling the young baronet about The Hound of the Baskervilles. Holmes said he needed twenty-four hours to think about the problem, and advised Mortimer to say nothing of the curse until then. Later in the adventure, Waterloo Station is where cabbie John Clayton dropped off his fare after he had followed Sir Henry and Dr. Mortimer. Although young Cartwright failed to find the hotel from which the note was sent, Holmes did locate the driver of the hansom cab. His name was John Clayton, who lived at the fictional Turpey Street in the Borough of Southwark. Clayton said that his fare was a detective. When Holmes asked the name he had given, Clayton replied, “Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” Holmes burst into a hearty laugh, and told Watson, “This time we have…a foeman who is worthy of our steel”. Conan Doyle gave 3 Turpey Street as John Clayton’s fictitious street address. Since Clayton kept his horse and cab at Shipley’s Yard, near Waterloo Station, we can assume he lived nearby. In 1890,, as now,, trains from London to Winchester leave from Waterloo Station. In The Adventure of the Copper Beeches, Holmes and Watson’s train left Waterloo Station at half-past nine, and arrived in Winchester at 11:30. They were curious about Violet Hunter’s predicament, since she had the freedom to meet them in Winchester. On a Monday in 1895, Watson caught the 9:13 train from Waterloo Station.
